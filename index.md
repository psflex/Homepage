##  Hi There, Welcome!
I currently a research fellow working with Prof. <a href='https://ece.ubc.ca/y-christine-chen/' target="_blank"> Y. Christine Chen </a> at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from <a href='https://www.ubc.ca/' target="_blank"> The University of British Columbia</a> (UBC). My research focus centers around **Advanced Optimization for Power System Flexibility, Cyber-Physical System Security and Privacy Protection** towards the affordable, reliable and sustainable goal for the clean energy future. Previously, I received the PhD degree at the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) from <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/' target="_blank"> The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> (PolyU), where I was very fortunately advised by Prof. <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-bu-siqi/' target="_blank"> Siqi Bu </a>, Prof. <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/prof-chung-chi-yung/' target="_blank"> C. Y. Chung</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/prof-chung-chin-shin-edward/' target="_blank"> Chin-shin Edward Chung</a> together. During PhD study, I was a visiting student at <a href='https://nus.edu.sg/' target="_blank"> National University of Singapore</a> (NUS) under the supervision of Prof. <a href='https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/gems/profhome.html' target="_blank"> Dipti Srinivasan</a>. And I used to be an experienced transmission/distribution system operator at State Grid of China. 
<p>I serve as an associate editor for the <a href='http://journal.ieee.ca/en/' target="_blank">IEEE Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> and a guest editor for <a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/smart-grids' target="_blank">Frontiers in Smart Grids</a> with a special issue on grid-edge flexibility. I have recently received the Best Paper Award in <a href='https://pes-gm.org/' target="_blank">IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM)</a> in United States and a Gold Medal from the <a href='https://www.cairs.hk/en/news_detail/index/44' target="_blank"> 49th The International Exhibition of Inventions Geneva</a> in Switzerland. To date, I have published over 20 papers in top <em>IEEE</em> transactions and international conferences, authored 1 academic book with China Electric Power Press, contributed 2 book chapters for an academic book <a href='https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-96-2612-0' target="_blank">Power and Energy Resources: Modelling and Optimization</a> with Springer Nature, and been granted 4 patents in China and Hong Kong. Please see <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6SzQKCAAAAAJ' target="_blank"> Google Scholar</a> and <a href='https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9787-2408' target="_blank">ORCID</a> for more details. </p>
